# 3D GIS and Terrain Modeling

## Overview

Explore three-dimensional geographic information systems and learn techniques for creating, analyzing, and visualizing 3D spatial data.

## 3D Data Types

### Terrain Models
- **Digital Elevation Models (DEM):** Raster elevation data
- **Digital Surface Models (DSM):** Including vegetation and buildings
- **Digital Terrain Models (DTM):** Bare earth elevation
- **Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN):** Vector-based terrain representation

### 3D Features
- **Buildings and Structures:** Extruded polygons with height attributes
- **Underground Features:** Tunnels, pipes, and geological layers
- **Vegetation:** 3D tree models and canopy structures
- **Water Bodies:** Bathymetry and flow modeling

## 3D Analysis Techniques

### Terrain Analysis
