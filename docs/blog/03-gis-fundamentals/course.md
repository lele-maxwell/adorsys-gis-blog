# Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Fundamentals

## Overview

This lesson covers the core concepts of Geographic Information Systems, providing a solid foundation for understanding spatial data and analysis.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic GIS concepts and terminology
- Types of spatial data (vector vs raster)
- Coordinate systems and projections
- Spatial analysis fundamentals
- GIS software overview

## Key Concepts

### Spatial Data Types

**Vector Data:**
- Points, lines, and polygons
- Discrete features with attributes
- Examples: cities, roads, property boundaries

**Raster Data:**
- Grid-based continuous data
- Pixel values represent attributes
- Examples: satellite imagery, elevation models

### Coordinate Systems

Understanding coordinate systems is crucial for accurate spatial analysis:

- **Geographic Coordinates:** Latitude and longitude
- **Projected Coordinates:** Cartesian systems for specific regions
- **Datum:** Reference surface for coordinate measurements

## Practical Applications

GIS is used across many industries:

- **Environmental Management:** Habitat mapping, pollution monitoring
- **Urban Planning:** Land use analysis, infrastructure planning
- **Business Intelligence:** Market analysis, location optimization
- **Emergency Response:** Disaster mapping, resource allocation

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson, you'll be ready to explore more advanced topics like spatial analysis, data visualization, and specialized GIS applications.
